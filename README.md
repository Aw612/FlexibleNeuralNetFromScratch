# FlexibleNeuralNetFromScratch

An implementation of a flexible neural network and backpropagation frrom scratch in Python using only NumPy as an external library.

A blog post explaining everything is available here: [Implementing a flexible neural network with backpropagation from scratch](https://blog.zhaytam.com/2018/08/15/implement-neural-network-backpropagation/).
